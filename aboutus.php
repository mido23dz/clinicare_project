                        <p class="text-center lead">Patients register on our site and can request appointments with specialist doctors based on their availability. Our clinic secretaries manage appointment requests, confirming or rejecting them according to the doctors' schedules. Patients can track their appointments through our site.</p>
                        <p class="text-center lead">During consultations, doctors can create and update medical files for patients, recording symptoms and diagnoses. If further tests are needed, doctors can request them directly through the site. Test results are added to the patient's file, allowing for comprehensive follow-up care.</p>
